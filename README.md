## Documentation
We use two classes one for the blockchain and one for the blocks:


```Javascript
class Blockchain {
    constructor() {
        let firstBlock = new Block(0, "05/12/2017", "first block");
        firstBlock.mineBlock();
        this.chain = [firstBlock];
    }
    getLatestBlock() {
    // this gets the last created block
    }
    addBlock(newBlock) {
    //this adds a block mined with the mineBlock1 function
    }
    addBlock2(newBlock) {
    //this adds a block mined with the mineBlock2 function
    }
    replaceChain(newChain) {
    //this is called if this instance receives a blockchain that is longer than itself
    //it broadcasts to its peers if it does replace the chain.
    }
    isBlockValid(newBlock) {
    //this is run by addBlock and addBlock2 to check if the block has a correct hash.
    };
    isChainValid() {
    //this is run by replaceChain to see if the received Blockchain is a valid Blockchain, so it does not contain bad blocks.
    }
}
```

```Javascript
class Block {
    constructor(index, timestamp, data, previousHash = '', nonce) {
        this.index = index;
        this.timestamp = timestamp;
        this.data = data
        this.previousHash = previousHash;
        this.hash = this.calculateHash()
        this.nonce = nonce || 0;
        this.timeUsed = 0;
    }
    calculateHash() {
    //this uses the 'crypto-js' npm package to make a hash from all the block parameters
    }
    mineBlock() {
    //this mines a block squentially
    this.nonce++
    //until it hits the proof of work defined, in this case the hash has to start with fac
    }
    mineBlock2() {
    //this mines a block randomly
    this.nonce = Math.random();
    //until it hits the proof of work defined, in this case the hash has to start with fac
    }
}
```
```Javascript
let generateBlockChain = function (newChain) {
// this is used to make json object received from the peer to peer into a blockchain
}
let initHttpServer = function () {
    app.get('/blocks', function (req, res) {
    //this sends the blockchain from this instance
    });
    app.post('/mineBlock/:type', function (req, res) {
    //this starts the mining process,
    //type is either 1 for sequential mining or eveything else is for random mining
    });
    app.get('/peers', function (req, res) {
    //this returns how many peers that are connected
    });
    app.post('/addPeer', function (req, res) {
    this adds a peer in the form of
    {"peer":"ws://node2:6001"} 
    //this is only in case its on the local network, another peer can also be added.
    });
};

let P2PServer = function () {
//this initializes the peer to beer network
}

let initConnection = function (conn) {
//this initializes a connection
};

let initMessageHandler = function (conn) {
 // this initializes a handler for messages, so it can broadcast, latest block, all blocks or receives blocks
};

let initErrorHandler = function (conn) {
 //this handles peer to peer errors, such as peers closing or returning in error
};

let connectToPeers = function (newPeers) {
   //this connets to peers or returns "connection failed" on error
};
let handleBlockchainResponse = function (message) {
   //this takes a message and makes it into a json array of blocks, and does one of 4 things:
   //1. if the latest block is a valid block it is added to the chain
   //2. if the message only has one block it queuries the peers for their blockchain
   //3. the message has more blocks than this instance, it is then first validated and replaced if the validation is true.
   //4. do nothing
};
let queryChainLengthMsg = function () {
    //queries the latest block
}
let queryAllMsg = function () {
    //queries the entire blockchain
}
let responseChainMsg = function () {
    //this sends the blockchain
}
let responseLatestMsg = function () {
    //this sends the latest block
};
let write = function (ws, message) {
    //this sends the message
}
let broadcast = function (message) {
    //this broadcasts the message to all peers.
}
```



## Demonstration 

#### Relevant Scripts:

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Thug-Lyfe/blockchain/blob/master/shotsForAss/3.PNG"alt="arch diagram" width="100%" height="100%" border="10"></p>

Both of the script highlighted with yellow in the above picture are bash scripts, and as such must be executed on a UNIX platform of some decription (tested on Linux mint 18.00 sarah (fork of ubuntu 16.04) in a standard bash shell).

After you clone our repository from github, all you need to do is navigate to the cloned folder, and type the following:

```sh
chmod +x quick_start.sh
chmod +x ScreenShotScript.sh

```
And when you want to run either of the scripts, you have to type the commands specified below.
NOTE:
<i>
If you installed docker and docker-compose, via the debian package manager (APT), it's possible that root access is required to execute the above scripts (due to docker requirering superuser permissions). In that case, simply append <i>sudo</i> before each of the following lines (alternatively your can type <i>$- sudo su</i> for a super user bash session.</i>

```sh
./quick_start.sh

or

./ScreenShotScript.sh

```

### Preface

Our demonstration of our blockchain project, will start 4 seperate nodes (on four different docker containers).

Of these containers node 1, node 2 and node 3 are connected to one another in the following way: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3. We'll come back to Node number 4 later.

### Screenshots and Explanations 

We have made a script called <i>ScreenShotScript.sh</i>, that demonstrates the workins of our system. (for screenshot purpose, otherwise use <i>quick_start.sh</i>) 

The first thing the script does, is run the following commands to build the images and the containers

```sh
docker build .
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Logically, only the second of the above commands should be nessecary, but we've found that our project dosen't work without the initial "docker build ."

Besides afore mentioned things, this command also connects the individual containers (nodes) with one another in such a fashion that the nodes are <i>"links in a chain"</i>. Below is an example from the docker-compose file.


```sh
  node3:
    environment:
      - PEERS=ws://node2:6001
    build:
      context: ./
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
    - "3003:3001"
    links:
      - node2:node2
```

Next, our script proceeds to mine two blocks a piece from each of nodes 1 to 3 (so the chain is made up of six blocks in total), this is illustrated in the following screendump.  


<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Thug-Lyfe/blockchain/blob/master/shotsForAss/1.png" alt="arch diagram" width="100%" height="100%" border="10"></p>


Now node 4 is still not connected, therefore our script runs the following:
```sh
echo "as you can see, it is only at block index 2, this is because it is not connected"
echo "so we add the NODE4 as a peer to NODE3"
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" -d '{"peer" : "ws://node4:6001"}' -X POST http://localhost:3003/addPeer
```

This connects node 4 to node 3, and when we mine two new blocks from node 4, it updates the chain, showing the connection is working:

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Thug-Lyfe/blockchain/blob/master/shotsForAss/2.png" alt="arch diagram" width="100%" height="100%" border="10"></p>


### Test it yourself

If you want to run our project yourself, you can refer to the <i>quick_start.sh</i> script, which takes you through quite a similar path to the <i>ScreenShotScript.sh</i> file. The only major difference being that quick_start have less verbose print lines, aswell as immediate connection to node 4.
